## Background

This started as a project I was doing for a local snow removal company specializing in residential customers. They were trying to scale their snow removal services but due to their lack of automation, they were bogged down with administrative overhead, repetitive tasks, and lack of visibility into company operations.

We carefully analyzed their key pain points:
* The owner was spending 25% or more of their work hours on repetitive administrative tasks like managing the routes his drivers would serve, processing customer billing and record keeping. This prevented the company from growing without compromising quality of service.
* There was no automated tracking of assets and personnel, so situation awareness, effective teamwork and accountability were severely limited.
* Existing SaaS solutions were too generic. They lacked specifically needed features and came bloated with unneeded features. 

## Process
Our approach was to pick one critical automation issue at a time and build the application to solve that one problem really well. We'd then test and refine that and begin using it in production. This would result in a very inexpensive application that has positive ROI for the customer really quickly. The improved business process would allow the business to take on more customers, and that added revenue would fund the next round of features and improvements for the application. Eventually, we wound up with a fairly comprehensive business management solution that radically transformed the business. 

## Major Features
### Route Management
A customer database with a simple drag-and-drop UI so that the manager can build and modify service routes for his employees easily. The employees have an iPad in each vehicle and can indicate work completed at the press of a button. This data is synchronized in real time across all devices to improve visibility, accountability, and situational awareness for improved teamwork. 
### Billing Integration
Built-in Stripe integration makes billing a breeze and helps the company get paid easily and on time. Easy CSV export of service records allows integration to other payment processors and book keeping solutions. 
### Pricing Templates
Innovative pricing builder allows unprecedented flexibility in what services you provide and how you charge customers. Pricing templates allow you to have lots of contract types and apply them quickly across your customer database.  

## Results
This comprehensive technology solution empowered the business to scale its residential customer base by about 60% while also adding commercial and municipal contracts. In the midst of all of that expansion, administrative overhead went down considerably along with errors and various sources of waste and friction within the company. Inspired by this success, we've now scaled up our software platform to allow other businesses to use the platform as well.
